<p>Just about 4 months ago Kaggle started hosting a very interesting competition with a prize money of $1,000,000: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a>. Although it is very tempting to try to get this kind of prize, for me it's always about learning when it comes to Kaggle competitions. Unfortunately, I joined the competition pretty late, about when only a month left, but still I tried to give 100% to see how much I can achieve and learn. The competition now ended but final results on the Private Leaderboard will be revealed once the participants' models are evaluted on a hold-out set by Facebook.</p>

<p>AWS, Facebook, Microsoft, the Partnership on AIâ€™s Media Integrity Steering Committee and academics came together and build this challenge by providing a dataset of ~100K (~500 GB) real and fake videos. First, I would like to thank all these organizations and individuals for creating this challenge and Kaggle for hosting it to let the best people in the field to work on such an important problem for our society.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, Deepfakes and similar content generation and manipulation adversery techniques are great threats for everyone in terms of quality of public discourse and the safeguarding of human rights. Misinformation can lead to dangerous and even fatal outcomes. These kind of threats not only appear in computer vision but also NLP. For example, Open AI's gigantic <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> model had similar controversies about advarsarial risks and the actual model trained by the team was not initially released for this same reason until some time.</p>

<blockquote><p>"These samples have substantial policy implications:large language models are becoming increasingly easy to steer towards scalable, customized, coherent text generation, which in turn <strong>could be used in a number of beneficial as well as malicious ways</strong>".</p>

<p>As AI techniques evolve, people will not stop using them for harmful purposes but this shouldn't enforce any barriers for technological development but rather allow everyone in the community to contribute to the fight against them through transparency. Those who are further interested and concerned about implications of AI in ethics and society can check out Fast.ai's blog series in <a href="https://www.fast.ai/topics/#ai-in-society">ai-in-society</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of the competition was to be able to detect real and fake videos. It can be simply framed as a video classification task. The provided training dataset had only the binary indicator of fakeness for each video and no other information beyond it. It was also stated that the fake videos can have visual, audio or both kinds of manipulations. The technical details for video manipulations were not mentioned to not to defeat the purpose of building a robust and general deepfake detection model pipeline.</p>

<p>The dataset was created with the help of volunteer actor videos. It had specific actors and no other public dataset. After exlporing the dataset and reading discussions in the forum it was more clear that various facial manipulations technique were employed in terms of quality and localization. It should also be noted that since deepfakes methods are also far from perfect it introduced a lot of noise to the training set.</p>
